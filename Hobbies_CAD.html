                            Over the past few years, I taught myself 3D modeling, beginning with Tinkercad and
                            progressing to Fusion360. Initially, this skill supported my work on the Varsity Science
                            Olympiad team, where it became invaluable to my position as a builder. Now, 3D modeling
                            serves as a welcome reprieve,
                            offering me an outlet for all my creative urges. Below, Iâ€™ve outlined the step-by-step
                            process
                            I followed throughout the 2023-24 Science Olympiad season to develop my design, which won
                            1st place at regionals. This design approach, using gradual iterations until reaching a
                            result I was satisfied with, has become my typical method when designing for the team.

                            For this event, participants designed a device powered by a 1.5kg falling mass to transport
                            an egg along a 9-12m track and stop it as close as possible to a terminal barrier without
                            cracking the egg (which was placed at the front of the vehicle). A mandatory obstacle, a
                            bucket, was placed at the halfway point, and the vehicle had to navigate around it. The
                            device, in its ready-to-launch position, had to fit within 0.75m by 0.75m by 0.5m, and no
                            electronics or remote controls could be used. The goal was to use gravitational potential
                            energy to move the egg safely and accurately to the end.</p>
