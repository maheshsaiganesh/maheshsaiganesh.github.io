                            <br />
                            My name is Mahesh and I will be a Junior during the 2023-24 school year. As of 2023,
                            Centerville has
                            been my home for about 4.5 years. My hobbies include sleeping, spending time with my dog,
                            and
                            procrastinating.
                            <br />
                            Although I remain primarily undecided, I wish to pursue any major that enables me to
                            contribute to society's
                            well-being; leaving a meaningful impact on the world. Despite a lack of career goals, I do
                            want that any
                            work
                            I do this primarily for the betterment of society. I come from a background of computer
                            science majors, hence
                            my interest in programming. Despite my lack of prior experience, I am eager to learn to
                            code; seeing that it
                            will equip me
                            with the skills and knowledge necessary to turn my ideas into reality.
                        </p>
