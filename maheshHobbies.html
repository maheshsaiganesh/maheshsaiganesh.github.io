                            <p>Meet Milo Sai Ganesh! He is the newest addition to our family at just 1 year and 4 months
                                old. As a 21lb aussiedoodle, he enjoys chasing rabbits and sniffing out treats. As a
                                faithful friend, he can be a great source of comfort and support during difficult times.
                                He enjoys long hikes in local parks although he can be a bit tough to care for(with all
                                the white fur on his feet). I can say with absolute certainty that he is the best pup
                                anyone could ask for!</p>

                            <p>First played in 1873 in England, badminton has been a long time favourite past time of
                                mine. Having trained for ~3 years as a child, I enjoy casual competitions against
                                members in my family. A type of indoor game played with a racket and a shuttlecock,
                                badminton can be played either between two players or two teams of two. </p>

                            <p>I find that comedy is my go-to stress busting method. As you mighty have guessed, my current favourite sketches are particularly from late-night live television sketch group SNL. I enjoy this sketch in particular for it’s parody of Amazon’s Alexa line of smart speakers.Other sources of comedy I enjoy watching include Monty Python(Life of Brian is my current favorite) and Seth Meyers. </p>
