                                serving as a leader junior and senior year). We strive to serve out community, one plant at a
                                time; with our main goal being to alleviate the drastic food shortages in our
                                communities. We grow our own fresh produce while simultaneously collecting donations
                                from willing neighbours/markets to donate to the ‘Food for the Journey Project’(a local
                                group that services the Dayton community). </p>

                            <p>I have volunteered with YGIC(Youth Group For Indian Culture) for almost two years now. As
                                a volunteer, I participated in creating winter clothing to be donated to the local food
                                pantry. It was here that I learned of the large population of Daytonians that live
                                without adequate food and shelter, along with the steps I could take to change this. In
                                the end, we donated over 50 handmade blankets and ponchos; having volunteered over 50
                                hours each.

                                two years now. TAB is a group of innovative and energetic teens in Grades 6 to 12, who
                                help shape the future of the Library by developing programs and services, recommending
                                materials for purchase, and promoting the Library to other teens. TAB meets twice a
                                month and has a blast creating new ways to make the Library "teen friendly."</p>
